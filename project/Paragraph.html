<p>William Blake (28 November 1757 â€“ 12 August 1827) was an English poet, 
    painter, and printmaker. Largely unrecognised during his life, 
    Blake has become a seminal figure in the history of the poetry 
    and visual art of the Romantic Age. What he called his "prophetic works" 
    were said by 20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form
    "what is in proportion to its merits the least read body 
    of poetry in the English language".[2] While he lived in London
    his entire life, except for three years spent in Felpham,[3] 
    he produced a diverse and symbolically rich collection of works, 
    which embraced the imagination as "the body of God",[4] or 
    "human existence itself".[5]</p>

<p>Although Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic views, 
    he came to be highly regarded by later critics and readers for 
    his expressiveness and creativity, and for the philosophical and mystical undercurrents 
    within his work. His paintings and poetry have been characterised as part of the Romantic 
    movement and as "Pre-Romantic".[6] </p>
